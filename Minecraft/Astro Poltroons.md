## Summary

This modpack has the Create mod for techincals, a default overworld biome and world generation, enhanced and additional structures, many dimensions for exploration and you can travel to the moon!



## Description

A modpack focused around the Create mod for the technical side of things. Build contraptions and trains and harvest the resources of the world!

We try to bring a slightly enhanced vanilla experience in the overworld with more food options, a little bit of tools and armor enhancements, much improved vanilla structures and also some additional structures. Though not too heavy on that side to keep the feel of a vanilla world at first.

We recommend adding Oh The Biomes You'll Go or Terralith for new and exiting biomes, and maybe something like When Dungeons Arise if you want an even more modded feeling to your (over)world. We chose to leave those out for this modpack. 

For exploration we have added some well known mods like The Aether and Twilight Forest but also a couple of new ones we have not experienced ourselves yet. Also you can build rocket ships, to go to space and explore the planets!

There is a quest book with some quests borrowed from the Create: Perfect World modpack but those does not cover any dimensional or space exploration mods. At least not yet.
